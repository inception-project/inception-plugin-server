== Installation

=== Run as Java application

All-in-one version which does not require a database server or servlet container to be set up.

[NOTE]
====
By default, {product-name} creates and uses an embedded database. It is not recommended to use the application in such a configuration for production use. Instead, please use a database server when
using it in production. For more information, please refer to the <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_database,Administrator Guide>>.
====

Get the stand-alone JAR from the link:https://inception-project.github.io/downloads/[downloads page] and start it simply with a *double-click* in your file manager. The application stores its data in a folder called `.inception` (_dot inception) within your home folder,

==== Optional configuration

Alternatively, you can start {product-name} from the command line, in particular if you wish to provide it with additional memory (here 1 GB) or if you want it to store its data in a different folder.

----
java -Xmx1g -Dinception.home=/my/inception/home -jar inception-app-standalone-XXX.jar
----

Mind to replace `/my/inception/home` with path of a folder where the application can store its data.

By default the server starts on port 8080 and you can access it via a browser at `http://localhost:8080` after you started it. You can add the parameter `-Dserver.port=9999` at the end of the command line to start the server on port 9999 (or choose any other port).

{product-name} uses link:https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot]. If you need to set additional parameters of the embedded webserver of the stand-alone version, please refer to the link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-embedded-servlet-containers.html[Spring Boot embedded container documentation].

=== Run using Docker

==== Quick start

If you have Docker installed, you can run {product-name} using

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker run -it --name inception-app -p8080:8080 inceptionproject/inception:{revnumber}
----

The command download {product-name} from Dockerhub and starts it on port 8080. If this port is not
available on your machine, you should provide another port to the `-p` parameter. 

The logs will be printed to the console. To stop the container, press `CTRL-C`.

To run the {product-name} docker in the background use 

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker run -d --name inception -p8080:8080 inceptionproject/inception:{revnumber}
----

Logs are accessible by typing 

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker logs inception
----

NOTE: Use `docker run` only the first time that you run {product-name}. If you try it a second time, Docker
      will complain about the name `inception` already being in use. If you follow Docker`s suggestion
      to delete the container, you will loose all your data. Further below, we explain how
      you can store your data outside the container in a folder on your host.
      
When you want to run the application again later, use the command

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker start -ai inception
----

or for the background mode 

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker start inception
----

==== Storing data on the host

If you follow the quick start instructions above, the application will store all its data inside the docker
container. This is normally not what you want because as soon as you delete the container, all data
is gone. That means for example that you cannot easily upgrade to a new version of the {product-name}
docker image when one is released.

To store your data on your host computer, first create a folder where you want to store your data.
For example, if you are on Linux, you could create a folder `/srv/inception`:

----
$ mkdir /srv/inception
----

When you run {product-name} via Docker, you then mount this folder into the container:

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker run -it --name inception -v /srv/inception:/export -p8080:8080 inceptionproject/inception:{revnumber}
----

==== Connecting to a MySQL database

By default, the application uses an embedded SQL database to store its metadata (not the texts and 
annotations, these are stored in files on disk). For production use, it is highly recommended to
use a separate MySQL database instead of the embedded SQL database.

You can do so by providing a second Docker for MySQL (see for example link:https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/[this one]).
We provide a docker-compose example file, which combines the two containers. In order to use this, download link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webanno/webanno/master/webanno-webapp/src/main/docker/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose.yml] and place it into any folder, change to that folder, and issue the commands 

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
export INCEPTION_HOME=/srv/inception
export INCEPTION_PORT=8080
docker-compose -p inception up -d
----

This will start two docker containers: inception_mysqlserver_1`, and `inception_webserver_1`. You can check the logs of each by running 

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker logs inception_mysqlserver_1
docker logs inception_webserver_1
----

Two directories in your {product-name} home folder will be created: `mysql-data` and `webserver-data`. No data is stored in the containers themselves, you are safe to delete them with 

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker-compose -p inception down
----

You can also just stop or pause them, please see the link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/[docker-compose reference] for details.

NOTE: The settings within the docker-compose.yml file are just examples. Adjust the database URL, username, and password accordingly.
